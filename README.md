📦 PlotChain – Blockchain-Based Land Record Management System
PlotChain is a decentralized land record management system built using blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and trust in property transactions. By leveraging smart contracts, PlotChain makes land ownership records immutable and verifiable, reducing fraud, disputes, and inefficiencies in the real estate ecosystem.

Landowner: Register and verify land
Government Official: Approve or reject land submissions
Buyer: View land and initiate ownership transfer
🌍 3D Land Visualization (Planned)
View geospatial land data in an intuitive 3D format for better understanding.

💸 Transparent Transactions
Every ownership change is traceable and publicly verifiable via blockchain.
